PHP DATE HANDLING
$date = date('Y-m-d', (strtotime($dateBeforeConvert)));

Note, still issue in :

1. department side -> couldn't fetch all department
2. employee photo, even with null property still didn't pass validation of employee.php

what we still need to do :

1. different UI for users
2. revamp UIs
3. print pdf feature - use "https://www.warungbelajar.com/cara-membuat-report-pdf-dengan-php-menggunakan-dompdf.html"

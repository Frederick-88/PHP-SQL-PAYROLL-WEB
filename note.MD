PHP DATE HANDLING
$date = date('Y-m-d', (strtotime($dateBeforeConvert)));

Note, still issue in :

1. department side -> couldn't fetch all department
2. employee photo, even with null property still didn't pass validation of employee.php

what we still need to do :

1. different UI for users
2. employee edit ( i think delete add working already )
3. reset password
